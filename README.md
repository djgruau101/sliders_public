# sliders_public
Testing ground for the most chaotic quiz ever.

The page starts with a number input field. The number in the field will be the number of sliders appearing afterwards. The sliders have value from 1 to 5 inclusively. The user can control the value of each slider, and can get the average of the values by clicking on the Calculate Average button.
